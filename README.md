# Titanic EDA

## Description  
This notebook performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to uncover hidden patterns and insights related to passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. It involves visualizing distributions, relationships, and survival outcomes based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

## Objectives  
- Explore and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset  
- Visualize relationships between passenger features and survival outcomes  
- Identify patterns and trends using statistical summaries and plots  
- Prepare insights for future predictive modeling

## Methodology / Steps  
- Load the dataset and display the first few entries  
- Check data types, null values, and duplicates  
- Generate descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical features  
- Visualize survival rates based on age, sex, passenger class, and embarkation port  
- Use bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps for correlation analysis  
- Draw conclusions based on key observations from the visual analysis

## Tools & Libraries Used  
Python, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib
