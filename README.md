# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset Using Python

## Problem Statement  
The Titanic dataset, provided by Kaggle, offers historical data on passengers aboard the Titanic. This project aims to analyze the factors that contributed to passenger survival during the disaster. By exploring attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, and embarkation port, the analysis uncovers key patterns that can inform future predictive modeling.

## Tools Used  
- Python: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook: for interactive analysis and visualization  
- Dataset Source: **[Dataset Source â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)**

## Description  
This notebook performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to uncover hidden patterns and survival-related insights through statistical analysis and data visualization. The focus is on understanding the relationships between passenger attributes and survival outcomes to support future classification modeling.

## Objectives  
- Explore and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset  
- Visualize relationships between passenger features and survival outcomes  
- Identify patterns and trends using statistical summaries and plots  
- Prepare insights for future predictive modeling

## Methodology / Steps  

### 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration  
- Loaded the dataset and displayed the first few entries  
- Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates  

### 2. Descriptive Statistics  
- Generated statistical summaries for numerical and categorical variables  
- Analyzed data distributions and frequency counts  

### 3. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis  
- Explored individual features such as Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, and Embarked  
- Examined survival rates across gender, class, and embarkation port  

### 4. Data Visualization  
- Created bar plots, histograms, violin plots, and pie charts  
- Used seaborn heatmaps to identify correlations among numerical features  

### 5. Insight Summary  
- Summarized key findings and patterns in survival  
- Highlighted features most relevant for model training

## Outcome 
- Gender and passenger class were found to be strong predictors of survival, with women and first-class passengers having the highest survival rates  
- Embarkation port and fare also showed moderate influence on survival outcomes  
- Provided a clean and structured dataset with visual insights for building predictive models  
- This EDA supports data-driven storytelling and model development for classification tasks
