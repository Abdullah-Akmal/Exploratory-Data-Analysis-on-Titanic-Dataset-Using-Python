# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset Using Python

## Problem Statement  
Understanding the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster is essential for building accurate predictive models and drawing historical insights. However, the raw passenger data contains a mix of numerical and categorical variables that require thorough exploration and preprocessing. This project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), aiming to identify key attributes—such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and embarkation port—that significantly impacted survival outcomes. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that will inform future machine learning models and support data-driven storytelling.

## Description  
This notebook performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to uncover hidden patterns and survival-related insights through statistical analysis and data visualization. The focus is on understanding the relationships between passenger attributes and survival outcomes to support future classification modeling.

## Methodology / Steps  

### 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration  
- Loaded the dataset and displayed the first few entries  
- Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates  

### 2. Descriptive Statistics  
- Generated statistical summaries for numerical and categorical variables  
- Analyzed data distributions and frequency counts  

### 3. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis  
- Explored individual features such as Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, and Embarked  
- Examined survival rates across gender, class, and embarkation port  

### 4. Data Visualization  
- Created bar plots, histograms, violin plots, and pie charts  
- Used seaborn heatmaps to identify correlations among numerical features  

### 5. Insight Summary  
- Summarized key findings and patterns in survival  
- Highlighted features most relevant for model training

## Outcome 
- Gender and passenger class were found to be strong predictors of survival, with women and first-class passengers having the highest survival rates  
- Embarkation port and fare also showed moderate influence on survival outcomes  
- Provided a clean and structured dataset with visual insights for building predictive models  
- This EDA supports data-driven storytelling and model development for classification tasks
